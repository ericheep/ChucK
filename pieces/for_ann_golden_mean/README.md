# for-ann-golden-mean

A recreation of James Tenney's "For Ann (rising)."
This recreation uses the the golden mean instead of a JI minor sixth, the result is that each first order difference tone reinforces the sine wave below it.

Analysis of the piece was done in Python using music information retrieval techniques to closely approximate the parameters that James Tenney used.

Requires ChucK 1.3.5.1 (gidora) which includes the WinFuncEnv chugin.
